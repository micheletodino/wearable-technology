# wearable-technology
In this repository will be described a prototype of wearable technology, made through Arduino and soon upgraded with LilyPad e-textile technology, realized at the High School Institute “Caravaggio” of San Gennaro Vesuviano, designed to support future “Six Thinking Hats” simplexity exercises at the University of Salerno and other studies about Emotions and Empathy. Focusing on wearable technologies is important because, in the future, they will be usual tools to support seamless learning. Besides, the IoT (Internet of Things) wearable technologies generate a continuum - in the teaching-learning process - for students who will learn seamless.
